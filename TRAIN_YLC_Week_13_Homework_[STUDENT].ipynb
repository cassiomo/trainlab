The college admissions dataset contains information on various factors that could influence admission decisions. The dataset includes attributes such as admission status (admit), Graduate Record Examination (GRE) score, Grade Point Average (GPA), socioeconomic status (SES), gender (Gender_Male), race, and undergraduate rank (rank). These features provide insights into the characteristics of applicants and their likelihood of being admitted to a college or university.\n",

        "* `gre`: Score obtained on the Graduate Record Examination (ranging from 200-800)\n",
        "* `gpa`: Grade point average (out of 4.00)\n",
        "* `ses`: Socioeconomic status (1: low, 2: medium, 3: high)\n",
        "* `Gender_Male`: A binary indicator of whether the student is male or female (0: female, 1: male)\n",
        "* `Race`: The race or ethnicity of applicants, which can be categorized into different groups (1: Hispanic, 2: Asian, 3: African American)\n",
